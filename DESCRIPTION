Title: Wrapper to ldns library for DNS calls from R
Version: 0.2.1

Description: Wrapper to ldns library for DNS calls from R. It provides
    vecorized & non-vectorized version of core DNS query functions and
    allows for vector or data frame return values in most functions
    (depending on the level of detail desired from the query). It's
    significantly faster than issuing a system() call but does not
    yet work under Windows.
